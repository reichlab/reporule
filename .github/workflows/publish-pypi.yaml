# .github/workflows/publish-pypi.yml

# This workflow uses PyPI's trusted publisher feature to publish the package
# to PyPI. The trusted publisher enables PyPI updates without needing
# to store secrets in the repository.
# There are three prerequisites:
# 1. Create a GitHub environment named `pypi` in the project's repository
# (if you use a different environment name, change the environment name below to match)
# 2. Add a "required reviewers" deployment protection rule to the above environment
# 3. Set up a trusted publisher on PyPI for the project
# Note: the pypi.org url in the publish-to-pypi job should be set to the name of
# your package on PyPI.

# Full documentation about this process:
# https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/publishing-package-distribution-releases-using-github-actions-ci-cd-workflows/
