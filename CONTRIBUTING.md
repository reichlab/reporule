# Contributing to reporule

## Reporting bugs

If something isn't working as described, or if you find a mistake in the
documentation, please feel free to report a bug by opening an issue.

## Contributing to the code base

Contributions to the code base are welcome. If you want to add a new feature,
please open an issue before doing any work, to ensure that the suggestion
aligns with the project's goals and overall direction.

If you'd like to tackle an existing issue, please leave a comment on it.

### Creating your local development environment

For contributing to this code base, you'll need:

- A [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed on your machine
- **optional**: [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
(the Python-based directions below use `uv`, but if you
already have a preferred Python toolset, that should work too)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have an active Python virtual environment (for example, conda's
> base environment), you'll need to deactivate it before following the
> instructions below.

#### Configure git

1. On GitHub, [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repository.

2. Clone the forked repository to your machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/<your github username>/<this-repo-name>.git
    cd <this-repo-name>
    ```

3. **optional:** Set the `upstream` remote to sync your fork with this
repository:

    ```sh
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/<this-repo-owner-or-org-name>/<this-repo-name>.git
    git fetch upstream
    ```

#### Install project and dependencies

1. From the root of the repo, create a virtual environment and install the
project dependencies. The
[`uv sync` command](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-sync) handles
installing Python, creating a virtual environment, and installing project
dependencies.

    ```sh
    uv sync
    ```

   (More information about how uv
    [finds or downloads a Python interpreter](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-python))

2. Run the test suite to check that everything works correctly:

    > [!TIP]
    > Prefixing python commands with `uv run` instructs uv to run the command
    > in the project's virtual environment, even if you haven't explicitly
    > activated it.

    ```sh
    uv run pytest
    ```

3. Install the `pre-commit` hooks used for linting and other checks (this may
take a few minutes but only needs to be done once).

    ```sh
    uv run pre-commit install
    ```

4. Make sure the `pre-commit` checks are working correctly:

    ```sh
    uv run pre-commit install
    ```

### Updating your development environment

If time has passed between your initial project setup and when you make changes
to the code, make sure your fork and development environment are up-to-date.

1. Sync your fork to the upstream repository:

    ```sh
    git checkout main
    git fetch upstream
    git rebase upstream/main
    git push origin main
    ```

2. Update your project dependencies:

    ```sh
    uv sync
    ```

### Adding project dependencies

If your change requires a new dependency, add it as follows:

```sh
uv add <dependency>
```

The [`uv add`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-add) command will:

- Add the dependency to `pyproject.toml`
- Install the dependency into the project's virtual environment
- Update the project's lockfile (`uv.lock`)

Make sure to commit the updated versions of `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.

### Updating documentation

This project uses [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) and
[MyST-flavored markdown](https://myst-parser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
for documentation.

Documentation updates should be made in `docs/source`. To preview
changes:

```bash
uv run --group docs sphinx-autobuild docs/source docs/_build/html
```

The output of the above command provides a URL for viewing the documentation via a
local server (usually [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)).

### Submitting code changes

After you've completed the changes described in the issue you're working on,
you can submit them by
[creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
(PR) to this repository.

Please ensure the following are true before creating the PR:

- Your change is covered by tests, if applicable
- Project documentation is updated, if applicable
- All tests pass (`uv run pytest`)
- All pre-commit checks are successful
(these checks will run automatically as you make commits)
- The `[Unreleased]` section of [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) contains a
description of your change.

The PR itself should:

- Have a descriptive title
- Be [linked to its corresponding issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/using-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue)
in the description.
- Have a description that includes any other information or context that will
help a code reviewer understand your changes.
